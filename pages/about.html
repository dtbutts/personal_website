                    My name is Dawson and I'm a software engineer with a passion for sharing my creations with others.
                    I didn't find my interest in software development until I attented college.
                    Since then, I've made it my full time career and create personal projects in my freetime.

                    I am focused in mobile development.
                    I found that apps are where myself and others have most of their experiences with software, so I set
                    my
                    sights to the field.
