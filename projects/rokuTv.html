            <h1>Roku TV Voice Remote</h1>



            <div style="padding-top: 20px;"></div>

            <p>
                As any good lazy slob knows, the worst part of my yearly GoT binge is having to reach for the remote to
                skip the intro.
                I tried to fix that issue by cutting out the button press.
                <br>


            <div class="top-blurb" style="display: flex; gap: 50px; padding-top: 20px;">
                <div style="flex: 1;">
                    <img style="width: 150px; height: auto;" src="/assets/images/RokuTV_logo_purple1.png"
                        alt="RokuTV Logo">
                </div>
                <div style="flex: 3;">
                    <p>
                        This Python script allows you to control your Roku TV completely by voice through keywords.
                        The program waits for the obvious commands "pause", "play", "left", etc. so you don't have
                        struggle with
                        the different UIs of different streaming services. Through language interpretation and your home
                        wifi network,
                        the program sends commands to the Roku API.

            <p>
                This project was a lot of fun to make. I had never worked with language models before this. Being from
                Wyoming, I generally think of my
                Western American English as having the newscaster's <span style="font-weight: bold;">"no accent"</span>.
                After seeing what
                Kaldi recognized my words as, I no
                longer think that's true.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I learned the how to install, configure, and develop on top of large existing codebases such as Kaldi.
                After considerate time following README directions
                and command line output, I was able to integrate into the speech recognition software.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                This also allowed me to refamiliarize with Python as I don't get to use the language regularly. It is
                very easy to use, but after dealing with other languages, the lack of parenthesis seems wrong.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Continue to explore different voice models and find the one that allows for the easiest pickup for
                    American accents.
                    If made available to a wider audience, create a way the user can select their own speech model.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set this script up to continuously run on a microcontroller with a microphone, always picking up as
                    you watch tv. Then you would never
                    have to even start and stop the program.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Currently, Kaldi listens in "chunks," so it is possible that the program stops listening and
                    processes mid-word.
                    Need to rework how the program grabs samples and interprets them.
                </li>
