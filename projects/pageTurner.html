            <p>
                I noticed an issue when my friends and I played music -
                we would always be huddled around a laptop looking at chords. Staring at a screen
                while playing live music is the exact opposite of what a crowd comes to see. For those who
                don't have the time to memorize a full 2 hour set of songs, how can you get the best of both
                worlds?
            </p>
            <br>


            <div class="top-blurb" style="display: flex; gap: 50px; padding-top: 20px;">
                <div style="flex: 2;">
                    <p>
                        This Apple Watch app helps an artist have the benefit of
                        seeing a chord progression while not having to look at a tablet, laptop, or sheets of music
                        during
                        their performance. Simply turn your Apple Watch to the inside of your wrist and peek when you
                        need to.

                        Sorry - <span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(255, 102, 0);">repository is private</span> -
                        I
                        think
                        this app has
                        legs.

            <p>
                This project taught me a lot about how to develop UI for very limited space. I had some idea of a
                limited interface from general mobile development, but WatchOS UI Kit
                doesn't even offer contraints for UI objects. This made me really focus on the design and make tough
                decisions on what was necessary vs. what I
                thought would look cute.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also learned the struggle of starting and stopping timers. To keep a tempo with the music, I had to
                manage changes with timers while still allowing
                that tempo to be change to the artist's preference. Timers can be a headache!
            </p>

            <h2>What's Coming Next...</h2>

            <p>
                To make this project better, I would like to:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create a scrolling effect rather than just having the chords change with no warning. This would help
                    musicians keep time and prepare for incoming changes
                    before they happen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a companion phone app that offers an interface for users to input songs and chords. This
                    would remove the barrier of currently hardcoding chords for songs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Network the companion app so that users can start to create a shared database of songs that anyone
                    can use on their watch.
                </li>
            </ul>
