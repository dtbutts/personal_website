                I noticed an issue when my friends and I played music -
                we would always be huddled around a laptop looking at chords. Starting at a screen
                while playing live music is the exact opposite of what a crowd comes to see. For those who
                don't have the time to memorized a full 2 hour set of songs, how can you get the best of both
                worlds?
            </p>

                This Apple Watch app helps an artist have the benefit of
                seeing a chord progression while not having to look at a tablet, laptop, or sheets of music
                during
                their performance. Simply turn your Apple Watch to the inside of your wrist and peek when you
                need to.
