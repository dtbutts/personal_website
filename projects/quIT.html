                As any good lazy slob knows, the worst part of watching tv is having to reach for the remote.
                I tried to fix that issue by further reducing the gap from someone's thoughts to technology.

                This Python script allows you to control your Roku TV completely by voice by listening for keywords.
                There are the obvous "pause", "play", "left", etc., but also some

                This project taught me a lot about how to develop UI for very limited space. I had some idea of a
                limited interface from general mobile development, but WatchOS UI Kit
                doesn't even offer contraints for UI objects. This made me really focus on the design and make tough
                decisions on what was necessary vs. what I
                thought would look cute.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I also learned the struggle of starting and stopping timers. To keep a tempo with the music, I had to
                manage changes with timers while still allowing
                that tempo to be change to the artist's preference. Timers can be a headache!

            <h2>What's Coming Next...</h2>

            <p>
                To make this project better, I would like to:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create a scrolling effect rather than just having the chords change with no warning. This would help
                    musicians keep time and prepare for incoming changes
                    before they happen.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Create a companion phone app that offers an interface for users to input songs and chords. This
                    would remove the barrier of currently hardcoding chords for songs.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Network the companion app so that users can start to create a shared database of songs that anyone
                    can use on their watch.
                </li>
            </ul>
