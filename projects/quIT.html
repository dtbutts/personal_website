                QuIT is an Android mobile app designed to help users quit their addiction through feedback,
                encouragement, community, and analytics.
            </p>

                    <p>
                        This project was near and dear to my heart as I tried to quit using nicotine during college.
                        Clearly the app didn't work considering my current weekly bill of Zyn pouches... but it
                        was the
                        first large project I was a part of.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I built this app with a team of three others during my time in school, so not all code is my
                        own.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p style="font-size: 13px;">(One team member - <a href="https://github.com/ikiefer1"

                    <p>
                        The database used for this app is no longer active, so it is no longer useful. However, it is
                        still a good look into my
                        experience and how I've evolved as a developer.

                This project taught me how to work in a team and assigns roles based on each members skills.

            <br>
            <p>
                This was the user based app I built. I learned how to hash passwords, keep information
                private, and create a good login system.

            <p>
                This project is no longer upkept and will not be added to. The Firebase account that was used is no
                longer available, so the app is longer usable.
